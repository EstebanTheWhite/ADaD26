# The Fellowship Companion - Artifact I: Situation & Intent

*`(For demonstration purposes only)`*

## 1. Situation

The Fellowship is on their journey to destroy the Ring. They are traveling together and face many dangers and problems along the way. Because the journey is long and difficult, they need support.

The situation is complex because many things can happen and the world is dangerous.

## 2. Intent

The intent of The Fellowship Companion is to help the Fellowship on their journey. The primary users are the Fellowship members.

The application should make it easier for them to work together and succeed. Everything that helps the Fellowship is part of the intent.

## 3. Value

The Fellowship gains value by having a system that supports them. Without the system, things would be harder and take more time.

The application is important because it improves efficiency and coordination. This will help them complete their mission successfully.

## 4. System Capabilities

**The system should:**

- Help the Fellowship communicate
- Track important information
- Support decision-making
- Provide useful guidance
- Make the journey easier
- Help avoid mistakes

These capabilities ensure the Fellowship can complete their task.

## 5. Assumptions & Constraints

It is assumed that the Fellowship uses the system regularly. The environment is dangerous and information might be missing.

There may be limited time and resources. Trust between members is important.

## Why this is weak

- Vague language (*"help"*, *"support"*, *"make things easier"*)
- No specific moment in the journey or concrete difficulty
- Intent is unbounded (*"everything that helps"*)
- Value is generic and interchangeable with almost any app
- Capabilities are abstract labels, not system-enabling statements
- Assumptions are listed but not connected to design implications
- Reads like a summary about software, not a reasoning for software

*`This example is not entirely wrong, but it is very generic and would be very hard to build on in later assignments.`*
