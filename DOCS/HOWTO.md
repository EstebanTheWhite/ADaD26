## 1. Setting up Your Repository

1. Create your initial project repository on GitHub.
2. Ensure the **folder structure** matches the following template:

        team name/
        │
        ├── README.md ← The Red of Westmarch
        ├── chapters/ ← chapters of The Red
        ├── designs/  ← Flows, wireframes
        ├── code/     ← code

3. Use **Codespaces** for development.

## 2. Updating The Red

Every phase includes a **Red Book update**, reflecting on:

- What you built
- How you approached it
- AI assistance used (explanations, modifications, limitations)
- Lessons learned

**Structure:**

    # The Red of Westmarch - Chapter X: Title

    ## Summary

    - Brief description of the artifact and its purpose.

    ## Artifact

    - Link to the artifact
    - Tasks

    ## AI Assistance

    - Explanations, modifications, limitations

    ## Lessons Learned

    - Insights, challenges, reflections

Submit updates in `/README.md` and as linked files in `/chapters/`.

## 3. Submission & Workflow

- All deliverables live in your repository in the correct folders.
- Each homework assignment has a deadline and must be stored here on GitHub and submitted in MS Teams.
- Red Book update is mandatory but not graded (used for feedback & peer engagement).
- Keep your artifact separate from the reflection, but always link them.
- Peer sharing occurs on the gamification platform: comment and like others' work (intrinsic rewards only).

## 4. Networking & Peer Feedback (Lord of the Tweets)

- Share your journey on our networking platform ([Lord of the Tweets](https://www.nafra.at/adad_st2026/)).
- Engage with others' work.
- Best engagement will receive recognition/prizes.

## 5. AI Usage Guidelines

- AI is allowed and encouraged for coding, design, and logic tasks.
- You must document outputs, limitations, and modifications in The Red.
- You should be able to explain what the AI produced, not just copy results.

**We are not interested in:**

- Prompt engineering
- Praising AI
- Hiding AI usage

**We are interested in:**

- What AI misunderstood
- Where you had to correct it
- What you decided, not the AI

## 6. Grading

**You are not graded on:**

- How much code you write
- How "advanced" your solution is

**You are graded on:**

- Whether you can think like someone who works with developers
- Whether you can explain decisions
- Whether you can reflect on tools (including AI)

*`Perfect code is not required. Intent and structure are.`*

## 7. General Tips

- Think like a developer: clarity, structure, and purpose matter more than fancy code.
- Commit often with meaningful messages.
- Keep artifacts organized and named consistently.
- Update The Red after each task (it tracks your journey).
- Check the templates in TEMPLATES/ for formatting guidance.
- Use the LOTR narrative to make your documentation memorable and interesting.
