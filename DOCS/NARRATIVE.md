## 1. Why a Narrative?

This course uses a shared narrative and system metaphor as a structural learning scaffold, not merely for entertainment or gamification.

In professional software development, isolated artifacts—flow diagrams, wireframes, logic rules, interfaces, and code—are rarely meaningful on their own. Their value emerges only when they describe the same system from different perspectives, reinforcing a coherent understanding. Without a shared frame, artifacts remain fragmented and can be superficially produced, or auto-generated, without deep comprehension.

**The narrative provides that frame of coherence:**

- **Common Language:** By working within a shared story, students develop a vocabulary for discussing behavior, constraints, authority, and trade-offs.
- **Cumulative Learning:** Each artifact—diagram, mockup, or code snippet—aligns with the same system model, mirroring professional software teams.
- **Enforced Rigor:** The narrative constrains the solution space, focuses design decisions, and prevents purely stylistic or superficial choices.
- **Reflective Practice:** Students capture their decisions, reasoning, and AI assistance in The Red Book, creating a coherent learning journey.

**Academic Foundation**

This course uses a shared system narrative as a learning scaffold grounded in **constructivist learning theory** (Lev Vygotsky) and **cognitive load theory** (John Sweller). By keeping the problem context constant, students can build and refine a single mental model across multiple artifacts rather than producing isolated solutions, supporting active knowledge construction. The narrative reduces extraneous cognitive load and enables deeper reasoning about system behavior, constraints, and trade-offs, in line with research emphasizing the need for **structured guidance in complex learning environments** (Paul A. Kirschner). It is used not for entertainment (alone), but to enforce coherence, comparability, and rigor in design work.

## 2. Lore and Setting

**Students in this course are Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Code:**

- Each student group represents a cohort of hobbits, small but resourceful, learning to navigate challenges together.
- The Fellowship Companion (TFC) is a system the hobbits build for themselves to survive and thrive on their journey - from the Shire to the Mount Doom (final assignment + review).
- **Gandalf acts as AI support and guide:** a mentor who advises, proposes options, and explains complex processes. Students interact with Gandalf as they would with AI assistants, asking for guidance, insight, and code generation, but ultimately making the decisions themselves.

**Narrative Anchor:** Students are embedded inside the fellowship, not external observers. They are active participants building tools to support their journey.

**Why Hobbits?**

- **Accessible:** Easy for students to identify with.
- **Focused:** Avoids dominance of larger characters whose narrative decisions would overshadow student agency.
- **Complementary:** Each hobbit represents a role in a software project (analyst, designer, developer, tester, communicator).

## 3. The Fellowship Companion

The Fellowship Companion is the **digital support system for the journey**.

The companion file ([Brief: The Fellowship Companion](DOCS/SYSTEMBRIEF.md)) details the specifics of the system, while this narrative situates the TFC in the broader journey.

In short, it is **the artifact of the course**, constructed incrementally across homework assignments:

 Phase | Location | Quote | System Building Metaphor |
 ----- | -------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
 P1: Application Concept | The Shire | *"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to." - Frodo Beutlin* | **Define requirements & scope for the TFC:** what the Fellowship will need to survive and navigate their journey. |
 P2: Application Design | Bree → Rivendell | *"It is the small everyday decisions of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay." - Gandalf* | **Plan flows, wireframes, and early static interfaces:** design features of the TFC aligned with the journey. |
 P3: Application Logic | Moria → Dead Marshes | *"The world is not in your books and maps. It’s out there." - Gandalf* | **Implement logic & interactive features:** code, workflows, external services. |
 P4: Application Synthesis | Mount Doom / Return to Shire | *"The tale grew in the telling." - J.R.R. Tolkien* | **Integrate all artifacts into the Fellowship Companion:** full system, demonstrating cumulative understanding and reflection. |

Each homework contributes directly to the system, ensuring all diagrams, pages, and code are coherent components, rather than isolated exercises.

## 5. The Role of Gandalf (AI)

**Gandalf is more than a tool:**

- **Advisor:** Suggests options, explains processes, identifies risks.
- **Mentor:** Guides thinking and reasoning without doing the work for the hobbits.
- **Mediator:** Helps translate between different artifacts (flows, wireframes, code).

Students are responsible for asking meaningful questions, understanding outputs, and documenting reasoning. AI is integrated in the narrative, supporting learning while keeping the hobbits (students) central.
