## Purpose of the Fellowship Companion (TFC)

*Adapt to your project...*

We are 5 hobbits on our great journey from the Shire to Mordor. Along the way, we need a system to support **our planning, decisions, communication, and survival**.  
The Fellowship Companion is a **evolving digital tool** we build together. It is not perfect, it is not finished - it evolves as we travel.

- **Who we are:** The Fellowship - a group of 5 hobbits (students) working together.  
- **What we build:** A companion system that helps manage our journey, resources, and tasks.  
- **Why we build it:** So our journey succeeds and we understand the mindset, logic, design, and practice of developers.

---

## Rules of our Journey

- All artifacts live in **this GitHub repo**.  
- Gandalf (the AI) is our companion: we may ask him for help, but we always **reflect on our decisions** in the Red Book.  
- Peer sharing is optional but highly recommended: it **keeps the Fellowship alive**.  
- **The Red Book of Westmark** (`README.md` + `/chapters/`) is our reflection log and living changelog.
