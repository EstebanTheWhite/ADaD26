## Q1: What if I don't know what to build?

- Start from the **requirements in Phase 1** (Red Book: Chapter I).
- Pick **one feature or component** to implement for this phase.
- Use AI for help, but **document all decisions** in The Red Book.
- Ask your instructors or peers if stuck; peer engagement is encouraged.

**This course does not test whether you already know:**

- What a *"good app"* is
- How to design the perfect system
- How to write production-ready code

**Instead, it tests whether you can:**

- Make **reasonable decisions**
- **Explain why** you made them

## Q2: Can I use AI for everything?

- Yes, AI is encouraged, but you must **explain the output**.
  - Include outputs, limitations and modifications in your Red Book.
- AI is a tool, not a shortcut.

## Q3: How do I submit assignment?

- **Commit artifacts** to your GitHub repo in the proper folder.
- **Update the Red Boo**k with reflections.
- **Submit your GitHub link** (assignment/chapter specific) in MS Teams (the GitHub repository is *"only"* a file storage system).

## Q4: What is The Red Book of Westmarch?

- It's your reflective journal, documenting each step of your journey.
- Includes artifact description, AI discussions, learning, and insights.
- Always update after every task.

**Is The Red Book (README updates) graded?**

*`No - but it is mandatory!`*

**Think of it as...**

- ... the shared memory of your project
- ... the place where your learning becomes visible

**If you do not maintain it...**

- ... you still receive points
- ... but you will receive minimal feedback

## Q5: How does gamification in this course work?

- Share your artifacts on the peer platform ([Lord of the Tweets](https://www.nafra.at/adad_st2026/)).
  - Use the specific GutHub pages link (e.g., *`https://username.github.io/The-Fellowship-of-the-Code-2026/artifacts/artifact-1/artifact-1-situation-intent.html`*).
    - Not the GitHub repository link (except for "*.mermaid.md" files, here use the repository link)
  - Only share your artifact, not the chapter.
- Engage with others' work (comment/like).
- No grades are attached; motivation is intrinsic.
- Top participants will receive recognition/prizes.

**Why do we do peer sharing / gamification if it's not graded?**

- Real development includes **communication**
- Explaining your work deepens **understanding**
- Intrinsic motivation lasts longer than grades

**Participation unlocks:**

- Feedback
- Discussion
- Informal rewards (surprises, recognition, influence)

*`You cannot "fail" by participating - only by disappearing.`*

## Q6: How do I structure artifacts in GitHub?

        The-Fellowship-of-the-Code-2026/
        │
        ├── README.md  ← The Red Book of Westmarch (index)
        ├── chapters/  ← chapters of The Red Book (e.g., "chapter-1-setting-out.md")
        └── artifacts/ ← artifacts of The Fellowship Companion
             └── artifact-x/ ← specific artifact (e.g., "artifact-1-situation-intent.md")
                  └── src/   ← flowcharts (*.mermaid.md), wireframes (images), code (*.html, *.css, *.js)

- Update `/README.md` and linked chapters for Red Book reflection

## Q7: How should I prepare for the next lecture?

- Complete assignment artifacts and Red Book updates.
- Review peer submissions.
- Reflect on challenges, successes, and AI usage.
- Be ready to discuss your artifacts and explain AI outputs in class.
- Read through the provided learning materials, which will also serve as a basis for the in-class quiz.

## Q8: What if I miss a deadline?

- Contact the instructor.
- Late assignment may reduce points in **assignment grading**, but Red Book updates remain a required part of the record.

## Q9: Do I need to complete every Red book update?

- Yes, each assignment reflection is mandatory.
- These are **not graded**, but essential for discussion and feedback.
  - If you miss the deadline for submitting your Red Book update, you will only receive points; you will not receive verbal feedback.

## Q10: Can I work in alone?

- No, you work as a group.
- Groups are allowed to collaborate for discussion purposes only, not for submitting shared artifacts.

## Q11: Is there one correct solution?

*`No.`*

**There are:**

- Clear requirements
- Clear constraints
- Clear learning goals

*`But there is no single correct product.`*

Two students can submit very different artifacts and both receive full points ...if:

- Their work is **consistent**.
- Their reasoning is **clear**.
- Their reflection is **genuine**.

## Q12: How creative am I allowed to be?

*`Creativity is welcome - clarity comes first.`*

**If your idea is:**

- Easy to explain
- Easy to understand
- Clearly linked to the assignment

*`...then it is appropriate.`*
*`If creativity makes your work harder to understand, simplify.`*

## Q13: How much code do I need to write?

*`Less than you think.`*

**This course is about:**

- **Understanding**
- **Explaining**
- **Connecting** concepts

**You may:**

- Write code yourself
- Generate code with AI
- Adapt existing examples

**What matters is that you can:**

- Explain **what** the code does
- Explain **why** it exists
- Explain **how** it fits into the system

## Q14: What if my assignment feels incomplete?

*`That is expected.`*

**This course is iterative:**

- Early work is intentionally partial
- Later phases refine and extend it
- Submit what you have, clearly marked, with reflection.

*`Incomplete but honest > polished but unclear.`*

## Q14: What happens if I fail a checkpoint (e.g., code review)?

**Checkpoints are:**

- Validation instruments (quizzes, code reviews)
- Learning moments

**If issues are found:**

- They reduce points in the related assignment
- They guide improvement for later work

*`They are not traps.`*

## Q15: Who should I ask if I'm stuck?

**In this order:**

- This GitHub repository (in full) (or **Gandalf, AI Steward of The Fellowship of the Code**)
- Your own README (Red Book of Westmarch)
- AI (with reflection)
- Your instructor
- Your peers

*`Being stuck is part of the process - staying stuck silently is not.`*
