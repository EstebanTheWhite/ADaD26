## What the Code Does

The code is for tracking rations. You can add or eat rations and see the number change.

## Identified Issues

**There are some bugs in the JavaScript code:**

- The main problem is that the rations do not always update correctly.
- Sometimes the number is wrong.

## Why the Issues Matter

This matters because the app does not work properly. Users could get confused.

## Fixes

I fixed the code by converting everything to numbers and moving some lines around.

    rations = Number(rations) + Number(value);

## AI Assistance Reflection

- I asked ChatGPT to fix the code. It gave me the correct solution.
- I learned that JavaScript has problems with strings and numbers.
