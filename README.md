## Why This Course Exists

Software development is no longer only for coders. For business & IT students, understanding **how developers think, plan, and implement software** is crucial for effective communication, management, and decision-making.  

**This course emphasizes:**

- **Developer mindset:** thinking like a developer to collaborate and lead projects.
- **AI-assisted development:** using AI tools responsibly to accelerate understanding.
- **Hands-on practice:** creating artifacts and a final integrated system, **the Fellowship Companion**.
- **Reflection:** documenting learning, AI experiences, and lessons in **the Red Book of Westmarch**.

---

## How We Teach

- Four modules, six physical lessons, multiple self-study assignments
- **Peer engagement** and **gamification** to motivate intrinsic participation.  
- All work occurs on **GitHub & Codespaces**; artifacts are versioned and shared.  
- **Each homework consists of two parts:**
  1. **Doing** - Creating a concrete artifact (flow, wireframe, web page, automation, ...).  
  2. **Reflecting & Sharing** - Updating **the Red Book of Westmarch**, documenting the process and AI usage, and sharing work and insights with peers.

## Phases & Modules

 Phase | Module | Focus | Key Artifacts |
 ----- | ------ | ----- | ------------- |
 1 | Application Concept | Developer mindset & requirements | Conceptual foundation, the Red Book |
 2 | Application Design | UX/UI, flows, wireframes, HTML & CSS | User decision flow, interface design, static interface, the Red Book chapter 1 & 2 |
 3 | Application Logic | Code comprehension, JavaScript, Libraries & Frameworks, APIs | Dynamic interface, automation/extension, the Red Book chapter 3 & 4 |
 4 | Application Synthesis | Integration, review, final system | Integrated Fellowship Companion, the Red Book chapter 5 |

> Each homework builds toward **the Fellowship Companion**, a digital system designed to support the journey (of the Fellowship) with planning, communication, decision-making, and resource management.
