## 1. Why This Course Exists

Software development is no longer only for coders. For business & IT students, understanding **how developers think, plan, and implement software** is crucial for effective communication, management, and decision-making.  

**This course emphasizes:**

- **Developer mindset:** thinking like a developer to collaborate and lead projects.
- **AI-assisted development:** using AI tools responsibly to accelerate understanding.
- **Hands-on practice:** creating artifacts and a final integrated system, **the Fellowship Companion**.
- **Reflection:** documenting learning, AI experiences, and lessons in **The Red Book of Westmarch**.

---

## 2. How We Will Work

- Four modules, six lessons, multiple self-study assignments
- **Peer engagement** and **gamification** to motivate intrinsic participation.  
- All work occurs on **GitHub & Codespaces**; artifacts are versioned and shared.  
- **Each homework consists of two parts:**
  1. **Doing** - Creating a concrete artifact (requirements document, flow, wireframe, web page, automation, ...).  
  2. **Reflecting & Sharing** - Updating **The Red Book of Westmarch**, documenting the process and AI usage, and sharing work and insights with peers.

---

## 3. Learning Outcomes

- Understand **software concepts and lifecycle**.
- Think and communicate like a developer.
- **Translate requirements** into flows, designs, and code.
- **Implement static and dynamic artifacts** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and low-code tools.
- **Reflect on AI assistance** and collaborative development.
- Integrate modular components into a complete system.

## 4. Phases & Modules

 Phase | Module | Lessons | Focus | Key Artifacts |
 ----- | ------ | ------- | ----- | ------------- |
 1 | Application Concept | Understanding | Software fundamentals & concepts, roles & responsibilities, software lifecycle | Conceptual foundation, The Red Book |
 2 | Application Design | Deciding, Representing | User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI), decisions, flows & designs, assumptions & constraints, web fundamentals & concepts, HTML & CSS basics | User decision flow, interface design, static interface, The Red Book chapter 1 & 2 |
 3 | Application Logic | Modeling, Connecting | Development fundamentals & concepts, Libraries & Frameworks, third-party tools & automation, APIs & integration, JavaScript basics | Dynamic interface, automation/extension, The Red Book chapter 3 & 4 |
 4 | Application Synthesis | Reviewing | Integration, extension, review | Integrated Fellowship Companion, The Red Book chapter 5 |

> Each homework builds toward **the Fellowship Companion**, a digital system designed to support the journey (of the Fellowship) with planning, communication, decision-making, and resource management.

## 5. Narrative

- You are **hobbits on a journey**, building a tool for the Fellowship's quest.
- Each phase corresponds to a stage of the journey, with LOTR quotes, examples and locations guiding learning and reflection.
- Students document their learning and AI reflections in **The Red Book of Westmarch**.

**Why a [(LOTR) Narrative](docs/narrative.md)?**

This course uses a shared system narrative as a learning scaffold grounded in **constructivist learning theory** (Lev Vygotsky) and **cognitive load theory** (John Sweller). By keeping the problem context constant, students can build and refine a single mental model across multiple artifacts rather than producing isolated solutions, supporting active knowledge construction. The narrative reduces extraneous cognitive load and enables deeper reasoning about system behavior, constraints, and trade-offs, in line with research emphasizing the need for **structured guidance in complex learning environments** (Paul A. Kirschner). It is used not for entertainment (alone), but to enforce coherence, comparability, and rigor in design work.

## 6. The Fellowship Companion

*`Throughout this course, you will work as part of they Fellowship supporting it on its journey from the Shire to Mordor.
The Fellowship is already on the move. Your task is not to simulate the journey - but to support it while it is happening.`*

**You will build [the Fellowship Companion](docs/systembrief.md):** a small digital product that helps the Fellowship make decisions, stay aligned, manage resources, and adapt to changing conditions along the way.
